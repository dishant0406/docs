title: Core System Model
description: Two layers of reality and the four cognitive boundaries.
---

Two layers of reality:
- LLM cognition: visible to a proxy (prompts, tools, responses).
- Runtime cognition: hidden state in the agent loop (retries, planner state, memory changes).

The four cognitive boundaries:
1. Planner step: the agent chooses the next action.
2. Memory retrieval: past information influences the decision.
3. LLM reasoning: the model generates action or response.
4. Tool execution: the external world is touched.

WhyOps instruments the boundaries, not framework internals.
