title: SDK Layer (Concept)
description: The runtime instrumentation layer for full decision context.
---

The SDK layer wraps decision boundaries to capture runtime cognition.

Planned capabilities:
- Tool execution truth (raw output vs LLM-received output).
- Tool retries and failures.
- Planner state per step.
- Memory retrieval candidates and filters.

Why it matters:
- This data explains why the agent behaved the way it did.
- It closes the gap between LLM reasoning and runtime reality.

Note: The SDK does not exist yet. This is a design target.
