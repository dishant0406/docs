title: Decision Loop Reconstruction
description: Rebuilding agent steps without deep framework hooks.
---

WhyOps reconstructs the agent loop by observing boundary events:
- LLM call -> tool execution -> LLM call -> tool execution.

This pattern infers step boundaries even without direct framework hooks.

Benefits:
- Framework-agnostic.
- Scales across tool stacks.
- Enables decision graphs and replay with minimal integration.

Limit:
- Some runtime state requires SDK instrumentation to be precise.
