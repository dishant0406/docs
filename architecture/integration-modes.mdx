title: Integration Modes (Concept)
description: Proxy and SDK modes, and why both are needed.
---

WhyOps has two planned integration paths:

Proxy mode (fast adoption):
- Minimal code changes (URL change or env var).
- Captures prompts, tools, and responses.
- Reconstructs decision loops by pattern inference.

SDK mode (deep visibility):
- Decorators or wrappers around tool execution and memory retrieval.
- Captures runtime state not visible to the LLM.
- Enables tool retries, planner state, and memory influence mapping.

Note: These modes are conceptual and not available yet.
