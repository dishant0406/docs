description: The high-level system architecture for WhyOps.
---

WhyOps is designed to reconstruct decision context, not just log events.

Key layers:
- LLM proxy: captures prompts, tool definitions, responses, and token usage.
- Tool wrapper: captures execution reality (inputs, outputs, retries, errors, latency).
- State builder: reconstructs the decision loop and produces a causal graph.

Outcome:
- A reproducible decision trace.
- A decision graph UI that reflects the agent topology.
- A replay engine that reconstructs state for debugging.
