title: Decision Graph UI
description: A graph-shaped interface for agent cognition.
---

Agents are graph systems, not linear logs. The UI should match the system topology.

Graph nodes represent:
- LLM decisions
- Tool executions
- Memory retrievals
- Planner steps
- Termination reasons

Edges represent causal influence:
- Memory -> LLM decision
- Tool output -> next step
- Planner state -> action selection

The decision graph is the fastest path to a developer "aha" moment.
