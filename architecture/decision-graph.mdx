# Decision Graph UI

Agents are graph-shaped systems. The UI should match the topology.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  U[User Query] --> L1[LLM: Choose Action]
  M1[Memory Retrieved] --> L1
  L1 --> T1[Tool: search_web]
  T1 --> L2[LLM: Synthesize]
  T1 -->|retry 1| T1
  T1 -->|retry 2| T1
  L2 --> R[Response]
```

## What the graph reveals

- Causal influence of memory and tools
- Retry loops and latency roots
- Runtime termination causes

<Callout type="info">
Decision graphs are more than visualization. They are the spine of replay and root-cause analysis.
