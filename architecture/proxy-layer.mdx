description: What the proxy is expected to capture and why it matters.

# Proxy Layer

The proxy captures **LLM cognition**: prompts, tools, responses, and usage.

## Captures

- System and user prompts
- Tool definitions and tool call requests
- Model responses
- Token usage and latency

```mermaid

  participant A as Agent
  participant P as WhyOps Proxy
  participant L as LLM

  A->>P: Request (prompt + tools)
  P->>L: Forwarded request
  L-->>P: Response
  P-->>A: Forwarded response
```

## What the proxy misses

- Internal tool retries
- Sanitized tool output
- Memory mutations and retrieval filtering
- Planner state and termination rules
