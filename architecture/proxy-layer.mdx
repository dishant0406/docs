title: Proxy Layer (Concept)
description: What the proxy is expected to capture and why it matters.
---

The proxy layer sees LLM cognition only. It is necessary but not sufficient.

Captured by the proxy:
- System prompt, user messages, and tools.
- LLM responses and tool call requests.
- Token usage and latency.

Limits:
- Silent retries, tool sanitization, and memory mutation happen outside the LLM.
- Proxy-only data can make failures look like model hallucinations.

Proxy mode is the adoption engine. SDK mode is the accuracy engine.
