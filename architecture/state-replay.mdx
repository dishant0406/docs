title: State Replay
description: Re-executable decision context for debugging.
---

State replay is the category-defining feature.

Goal:
- Recreate the exact decision environment that led to a failure.
- Allow a developer to modify inputs and re-run the agent in a controlled environment.

Replay requires:
- Prompt state
- Tool definitions and parameters
- Memory retrieval results
- Runtime limits and planner state

This turns production failures into debuggable, reproducible sessions.
