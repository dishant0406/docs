title: State Replay
description: Re-executable decision context for debugging.
---


State replay turns production failures into debuggable sessions by recreating the decision environment.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant P as Production
  participant W as WhyOps
  participant D as Developer

  P->>W: Failure event + state
  W-->>D: Replayable snapshot
  D->>W: Modify input + re-run
  W-->>D: Results + diff
```

## What replay needs

- Prompt + tool definitions
- Memory retrieval results
- Planner state + runtime limits
- Tool outputs and errors
