description: Why agent systems are hard to debug with traditional observability.

Agent failures look random because their decision state is invisible.

Typical developer questions:
- Why did the agent call this tool?
- Why did it retry four times?
- Why did it ignore the correct document?
- Why did it stop early?
- Why did it hallucinate with correct data available?

Root cause:
- LLMs are stateless, but agent runtimes are stateful.
- Frameworks mutate state outside the LLM prompt.
- Existing tools log LLM calls, not runtime cognition.

WhyOps targets the missing layer: interpretability and state reproducibility for agent runtimes.
