title: Agent Termination Event
description: Why execution stopped outside the LLM.
---

Purpose:
- Attribute termination to runtime limits, not model intent.

Example:
```json
{
  "event": "agent_termination",
  "thread_id": "t1",
  "reason": "max_iterations",
  "steps_used": 5,
  "steps_allowed": 5,
  "last_llm_state": "requested_tool_call",
  "incomplete": true,
  "timestamp": "2026-01-28T10:30:45Z"
}
```

Key value:
- Avoids false attribution to LLM decisions.
- Enables clearer failure classification.
