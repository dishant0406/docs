title: Event Schema Overview
description: The five canonical event types and their cognitive value.
---

WhyOps uses event schemas that map to decision boundaries.

Canonical event types:
- llm_call: what the model saw and produced
- tool_execution: what actually happened outside the LLM
- memory_retrieval: which knowledge influenced a decision
- planner_step: strategy and internal decision state
- agent_termination: why execution stopped

Each event is linked by thread and step metadata for DAG reconstruction.
