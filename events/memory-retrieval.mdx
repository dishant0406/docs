title: Memory Retrieval Event
description: What knowledge influenced a decision.
---


Memory retrieval is cognition. Memory storage is not. This event captures which knowledge influenced a decision.

## Example

```json
{
  "event": "memory_retrieval",
  "thread_id": "t1",
  "query": "climate policy",
  "candidates_found": 18,
  "used_in_prompt": 4,
  "similarity_scores": [0.91, 0.87, 0.82, 0.80],
  "memory_ids": ["m12", "m98", "m2", "m44"],
  "filter_reason": "top_k=4, threshold=0.8",
  "dropped_candidates": 14,
  "rewrite_applied": "climate policy economic impact"
}
```

## Diagnostic value

- Shows what was **considered** vs **used**
- Explains retrieval drift across runs
- Enables threshold tuning
