Purpose:
- Capture the memory candidates and filters that shaped the prompt.

Example:
```json
{
  "event": "memory_retrieval",
  "thread_id": "t1",
  "query": "climate policy",
  "candidates_found": 18,
  "used_in_prompt": 4,
  "similarity_scores": [0.91, 0.87, 0.82, 0.80],
  "memory_ids": ["m12", "m98", "m2", "m44"],
  "filter_reason": "top_k=4, threshold=0.8",
  "dropped_candidates": 14,
  "rewrite_applied": "climate policy economic impact"
}
```

Key value:
- Shows what knowledge was considered and rejected.
- Enables retrieval quality diagnostics.
