# Planner Step Event

Planner state is ephemeral cognition. It must be captured every iteration.

## Example

```json
{
  "event": "planner_step",
  "thread_id": "t1",
  "step": 3,
  "max_steps": 5,
  "last_tool_error": "timeout",
  "retry_count": 2,
  "confidence_score": 0.41,
  "decision": "retry_tool",
  "reasoning": "Previous timeout suggests network issue, attempting retry with backoff",
  "state_snapshot": {
    "plan_remaining": ["verify_data", "synthesize_response"],
    "execution_mode": "cautious"
  }
}
```

## Why it matters

- Explains strategy shifts
- Shows why retries happened
- Prevents misattribution to the LLM
