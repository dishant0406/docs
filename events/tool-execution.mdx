# Tool Execution Event

This event captures the reality of tool execution, including failures and retries that the LLM never sees.

## Example

```json
{
  "event": "tool_execution",
  "thread_id": "t1",
  "tool": "get_weather",
  "args": {"city": "NYC"},
  "success": false,
  "error": "timeout",
  "error_raw": "ConnectionTimeout: host api.weather.com timeout after 5000ms",
  "retry": 2,
  "duration_ms": 5234,
  "llm_received": "Weather service unavailable",
  "actual_output": null
}
```

## Why it matters

- Reveals silent retry loops
- Detects tool output sanitization
- Explains latency spikes

<Callout type="tip">
The `llm_received` vs `actual_output` delta is a core differentiator.
