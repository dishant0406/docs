title: Tool Execution Event
description: The ground truth of tool I/O, retries, and errors.
---

Purpose:
- Capture what really happened when a tool ran.
- Compare actual output to what the LLM received.

Example:
```json
{
  "event": "tool_execution",
  "thread_id": "t1",
  "tool": "get_weather",
  "args": {"city": "NYC"},
  "success": false,
  "error": "timeout",
  "error_raw": "ConnectionTimeout: host api.weather.com timeout after 5000ms",
  "retry": 2,
  "duration_ms": 5234,
  "llm_received": "Weather service unavailable",
  "actual_output": null
}
```

Key value:
- Surfaces silent retries.
- Shows tool output sanitization.
- Explains latency spikes and failure chains.
