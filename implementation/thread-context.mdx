title: Thread Context Propagation
description: Keeping every event linked to a decision thread.
---

Correctness depends on linking every event to a single thread.

Planned design:
- A context API exposes thread and step IDs at runtime.
- Tool wrappers attach the current context automatically.
- Retries inherit the parent context.

Outcome:
- Reliable event correlation.
- Accurate decision graphs and replay.
