title: Phase 2 (SDK Instrumentation)
description: Deep runtime visibility for power users.
---

Phase 2 goals:
- Tool wrapper with retries, errors, and latency truth.
- Memory retrieval event capture.
- Planner state events per iteration.
- Full decision context for replay accuracy.

Why it matters:
- Unlocks silent retry detection and memory influence mapping.
- Enables accurate root-cause analysis.

Note: This phase is planned. No SDK is available yet.
