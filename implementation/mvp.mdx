The minimal demo must prove the **replayable decision state**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="State snapshot">
    Capture the decision environment before each step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Decision graph">
    Visualize steps and causal links.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Replay">
    Recreate production failures in dev.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Out of scope for MVP

- Constraint tracking
- Suggestion engine
- Predictive reliability
