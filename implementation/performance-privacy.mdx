title: Performance and Privacy
description: How WhyOps should behave in production.
---

Performance targets:
- Proxy adds minimal latency per LLM call (tens of ms).
- SDK events are recorded asynchronously.
- Uploads are batched to reduce overhead.

Privacy and security considerations:
- Optional on-prem proxy deployment.
- Encryption in transit and at rest.
- PII scrubbing and retention controls.
- Role-based access and auditability.
