title: Implementation Principles
description: The design rules that keep WhyOps scalable.
---

Guiding principles:
- Wrap decision boundaries, not infrastructure.
- Prefer framework-agnostic instrumentation.
- Separate adoption (proxy) from accuracy (SDK).
- Build reconstruction logic from boundary events.

Good targets:
- memory.retrieve()
- tool.run()
- planner.step()
- llm.call()

Avoid:
- Deep framework internals
- Vector database instrumentation
- Custom adapters for every framework
