title: Phase 1 (Proxy-Only)
description: Fast adoption and decision trace viewing.
---

Phase 1 goals:
- LLM proxy for prompts, tools, responses, latency, and tokens.
- Tool call detection and association with LLM requests.
- Decision graph UI from inferred step boundaries.
- Replay based on LLM-visible state.

Why it matters:
- Zero-friction adoption.
- Immediate visual value.

Note: This phase is planned. No proxy is available yet.
