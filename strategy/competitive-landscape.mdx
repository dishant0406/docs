# Competitive Landscape

| Tool | Focus | WhyOps difference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LangFuse | LLM observability | Agent cognition reconstruction |
| LangSmith | Prompt debugging | Decision environment capture |
| Helicone | API monitoring | Runtime state visibility |
| Datadog | Service APM | Cognition-level tracing |

## Differentiators

- Tool output vs LLM-received output
- Memory influence mapping
- Planner state visibility
- Silent retry detection
- State replay
