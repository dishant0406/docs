title: Competitive Landscape
description: How WhyOps differs from existing observability tools.
---

Comparison:
- LangFuse, LangSmith, Helicone: LLM call observability.
- WhyOps: agent cognition and decision reconstruction.

Differentiators:
- Tool output vs LLM-received output.
- Memory influence mapping.
- Planner state visibility.
- Silent retry detection.
- State replay.

WhyOps is closer to "Datadog for agent cognition" than to a trace viewer.
