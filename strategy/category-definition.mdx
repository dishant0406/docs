description: WhyOps as a new infrastructure layer.

WhyOps defines **Agent Runtime Observability (ARO)**.

## Category insight

- Agents are not unreliable because models are bad.
- Agents are un-debuggable because decision state is invisible.

## Why this matters

This reframing turns a tooling problem into a new infrastructure category.
