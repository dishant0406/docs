description: WhyOps as a new infrastructure layer.

WhyOps defines Agent Runtime Observability (ARO).

Category insight:
- Agents are not unreliable because models are bad.
- Agents are un-debuggable because decision state is invisible.

This reframes the problem from model quality to decision infrastructure.
