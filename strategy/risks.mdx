description: The main risks to execution and how to address them.

Key risks:
- Framework changes break integrations.
- Performance overhead.
- Data privacy concerns.
- Competitor feature copy.
- Agent paradigm shifts.

Mitigations:
- Framework-agnostic boundary instrumentation.
- Async logging and batching.
- On-prem and encryption options.
- Data moat from historical failure patterns.
- Focus on cognition boundaries, not tooling trends.
