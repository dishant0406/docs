# Memory Mutation Outside the LLM

## Scenario

- Runtime writes to memory without involving the LLM.
- Future decisions are influenced by that memory.

## Why it is hard to debug

- Proxy does not see memory changes.
- Behavior changes appear unexplained.

## WhyOps value

- Focuses on **memory retrieval** events.
- Links retrieved memories to subsequent decisions.
