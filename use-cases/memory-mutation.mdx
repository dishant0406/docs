title: Memory Mutation Outside the LLM
description: Memory changes that shape future decisions without LLM visibility.
---

Scenario:
- Runtime stores results to memory without passing through the LLM.
- Future decisions are influenced by this state.

Why it is hard to debug:
- Proxy cannot see these changes.
- Developers see shifts in behavior without clear cause.

WhyOps value:
- Focuses on memory retrieval events that influence decisions.
- Links retrieved memories to subsequent LLM calls.
