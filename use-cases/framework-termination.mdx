title: Framework-Driven Termination
description: When agents stop without model intent.
---


## Scenario

- Execution stops due to max iterations, timeout, or token budget.

## Why it is hard to debug

- Proxy-only logs make it look like the LLM stopped.

## WhyOps value

- Agent termination events explain the true stop reason.
- Prevents misattribution to model quality.
