title: Silent Tool Retries
description: Why proxies miss internal retry loops.
---

Scenario:
- LLM calls a tool.
- Tool fails and the framework retries internally.
- Only the final success is sent to the LLM.

Why it is hard to debug:
- Proxy sees no retries.
- LLM never knows a failure happened.
- Latency spikes appear unexplained.

WhyOps value:
- Tool execution events capture retries, failures, and timing.
- Planner state reveals whether retries were strategic or automatic.
