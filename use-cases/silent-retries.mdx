# Silent Tool Retries

## Scenario

- LLM requests a tool.
- The tool fails.
- The framework retries internally.
- Only the final success is sent to the LLM.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant L as LLM
  participant R as Runtime
  participant T as Tool

  L->>R: Call tool
  R->>T: Attempt 1
  T-->>R: Timeout
  R->>T: Attempt 2
  T-->>R: Timeout
  R->>T: Attempt 3
  T-->>R: Success
  R-->>L: Success (no failures shown)
```

## Why it is hard to debug

- Proxy sees one tool call and one success.
- Latency spikes have no obvious cause.

## WhyOps value

- Tool execution event captures every retry.
- Planner step shows whether the retry was strategic or automatic.
