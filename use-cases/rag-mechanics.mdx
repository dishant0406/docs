description: Retrieval steps that are invisible to the LLM.

Scenario:
- Query rewriting, vector search, ranking, and filtering happen before the prompt.

Why it is hard to debug:
- Proxy sees only the final injected context.
- Two runs can look identical while coming from different retrieval paths.

WhyOps value:
- Memory retrieval events reveal candidates, scores, and filters.
- Enables analysis of retrieval quality and drift.
