# RAG Mechanics and Hidden Cognition

## Scenario

- Query is rewritten.
- Embeddings searched and ranked.
- Top-k filtered.
- Summary injected into prompt.

## Why it is hard to debug

- Proxy only sees the final injected text.
- Retrieval path is hidden.

## WhyOps value

- Memory retrieval events capture scores, thresholds, and candidates.
- Makes retrieval quality observable.
