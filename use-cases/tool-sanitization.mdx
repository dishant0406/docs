# Tool Output Sanitization

## Scenario

- Tool returns malformed JSON.
- Framework catches the error.
- Framework sends a cleaned message to the LLM.

## Why it is hard to debug

- The proxy logs only the cleaned error.
- Root cause is hidden.

## WhyOps value

- Captures `actual_output` vs `llm_received`.
- Shows sanitization deltas in the decision graph.
