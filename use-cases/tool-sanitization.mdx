title: Tool Output Sanitization
description: When frameworks mask real errors.
---

Scenario:
- Tool returns malformed output.
- Framework sanitizes the error before passing it to the LLM.

Why it is hard to debug:
- The proxy logs the cleaned message, not the real error.
- Developers chase the wrong root cause.

WhyOps value:
- Records both actual output and LLM-received output.
- Makes sanitization visible in the decision graph.
