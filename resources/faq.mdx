## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is WhyOps?" icon="question">
    WhyOps is an **Agent Runtime Observability** platform that captures the complete decision-making process of AI agents—not just their inputs and outputs.
    
    Unlike traditional observability tools that only log LLM API calls, WhyOps instruments the four cognitive boundaries where agents make decisions:
    - Planner steps (strategy decisions)
    - Memory retrievals (knowledge influence)
    - LLM reasoning (model outputs)
    - Tool executions (external actions)
    
    This enables you to understand **why** an agent made a specific decision, not just **what** it did.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is WhyOps different from LangSmith/Langfuse/Helicone?" icon="code-compare">
    **Current Tools (LangSmith, Langfuse, Helicone):**
    - Focus: LLM API observability
    - Capture: Prompts, completions, token usage
    - Visibility: ~70% of agent behavior
    - Use case: Tracking LLM calls and costs
    
    **WhyOps:**
    - Focus: Agent cognition observability
    - Capture: Decision environment, runtime state, cognitive boundaries
    - Visibility: ~95% of agent behavior
    - Use case: Understanding why decisions were made + reproducible debugging
    
    **Key Differentiators:**
    - ✅ Tool execution reality (not just requests)
    - ✅ Memory retrieval influence
    - ✅ Planner internal state
    - ✅ Silent retry tracking
    - ✅ **State Replay** for debugging
    
    See [Competitive Landscape](/strategy/competitive-landscape) for detailed comparison.

## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What agent frameworks does WhyOps support?" icon="cubes">
    **Framework-Agnostic by Design**
    
    WhyOps instruments **universal decision boundaries** instead of framework-specific APIs:
    
    | Boundary | How We Capture | Framework-Independent? |
    |----------|---------------|------------------------|
    | LLM calls | Proxy or SDK wrapper | ✅ Yes |
    | Tool execution | Function decorator | ✅ Yes |
    | Memory retrieval | Retrieval hook | ✅ Yes |
    | Planner steps | State snapshot | ⚠️ Partial |
    
    **Supported Frameworks (planned):**
    - LangChain / LangGraph
    - CrewAI
    - AutoGen
    - Custom agent implementations
    - Any framework that uses Python functions
    
    See [Architecture Principles](/implementation/principles) for design philosophy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the Proxy mode work?" icon="network-wired">
    **Proxy Mode** = Minimal integration, ~70-80% visibility
    
    ```mermaid
    flowchart LR
        A[Your Agent Code] -->|LLM Requests| B[WhyOps Proxy]
        B -->|Forwarded| C[OpenAI/Anthropic/etc]
        C -->|Responses| B
        B -->|Logged + Forwarded| A
    ```
    
    **Setup:**
    ```python
    # Change only this line:
    # Before
    openai.api_base = "https://api.openai.com"
    
    # After
    openai.api_base = "https://proxy.whyops.ai"
    ```
    
    **What Proxy Captures:**
    - ✅ All LLM requests/responses
    - ✅ Tool definitions in prompts
    - ✅ Tool call requests from LLM
    - ✅ Tool results sent back to LLM
    - ✅ Token usage and latency
    - ✅ Conversation flow
    
    **What Proxy Misses:**
    - ❌ Silent retries in framework
    - ❌ Tool execution errors (sanitized by framework)
    - ❌ Memory retrieval details
    - ❌ Planner internal state
    
    See [Proxy Architecture](/architecture/proxy-layer) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the SDK mode work?" icon="code">
    **SDK Mode** = Deeper integration, ~95% visibility
    
    **Installation:**
    ```bash
    pip install whyops  # (future)
    ```
    
    **Tool Instrumentation:**
    ```python
    from whyops import tool
    
    @tool
    def search_database(query: str):
        # Your tool logic
        results = db.query(query)
        return results
    
    # WhyOps automatically captures:
    # - Function args
    # - Execution time
    # - Return value
    # - Exceptions/retries
    # - Thread context
    ```
    
    **Memory Instrumentation:**
    ```python
    from whyops import memory_retrieval
    
    @memory_retrieval
    def get_relevant_docs(query: str):
        # Your retrieval logic
        docs = vector_db.search(query, top_k=5)
        return docs
    
    # WhyOps automatically captures:
    # - Query text
    # - Candidates found
    # - Similarity scores
    # - Filter config
    # - Documents used
    ```
    
    **Context Propagation (Automatic):**
    ```python
    # No manual thread_id passing needed
    from whyops import context
    
    thread_id = context.thread_id()  # Auto-retrieved
    ```
    
    See [SDK Architecture](/architecture/sdk-layer) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is State Replay and how does it work?" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    **State Replay** = Reproduce production failures in development
    
    **The Problem:**
    - Agent fails in production
    - Can't reproduce locally
    - Logs don't show enough context
    
    **WhyOps Solution:**
    1. Capture complete decision environment when failure occurs
    2. Export as replay package
    3. Load in local dev environment
    4. Step through execution with full context
    
    **Example:**
    ```python
    # Load production failure locally
    from whyops import replay
    
    session = replay.load("prod_failure_47293.json")
    
    # Inspect state at failure point
    session.step_to(5)  # Step where it failed
    session.inspect_memory()  # See what docs were retrieved
    session.inspect_tools()   # See what tools were available
    
    # Test hypothesis
    session.override_config({"threshold": 0.7})
    result = session.replay_from_step(3)
    ```
    
    **Typical Time Savings:** 4-6 hours → 15 minutes
    
    See [State Replay Feature](/features/state-replay) for comprehensive guide.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you handle privacy and sensitive data?" icon="shield">
    **Privacy-First Design**
    
    | Data Type | Storage | Used For |
    |-----------|---------|----------|
    | LLM prompts/responses | Customer-controlled | Decision graphs |
    | Tool inputs/outputs | Sanitized or local-only | Execution traces |
    | Memory content | Hashed signatures only | Retrieval patterns |
    | Failure patterns | Anonymized aggregates | Pattern matching |
    | User data | Never stored | N/A |
    
    **Options:**
    - **Cloud Mode:** Encrypted storage, automatic PII redaction
    - **On-Premise Mode:** All data stays in your infrastructure
    - **Local-Only Mode:** No data leaves your environment
    
    **State Replay Privacy:**
    - Automatically redacts PII in replay packages
    - User controls what's included
    - Supports anonymized/synthetic data substitution
    
    See [Performance &amp; Privacy](/implementation/performance-privacy) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the performance overhead?" icon="gauge">
    **Design Goal:** &lt;5% latency overhead
    
    **Proxy Mode Overhead:**
    - Network: ~10-20ms (proxy hop)
    - Processing: ~5-15ms (event logging)
    - **Total:** ~15-35ms per LLM call
    
    **SDK Mode Overhead:**
    - Tool wrapper: ~2-5ms per call
    - Memory hook: ~3-8ms per retrieval
    - Event serialization: ~5-10ms (async)
    - **Total:** ~10-23ms per instrumented operation
    
    **Optimizations:**
    - Async event logging (non-blocking)
    - Local buffering with batch uploads
    - Sampling for high-volume agents
    - Configurable verbosity levels
    
    See [Performance Considerations](/implementation/performance-privacy) for benchmarks.

## Use Case Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When should I use WhyOps?" icon="lightbulb">
    **Ideal Use Cases:**
    
    ✅ **Production Agent Debugging**
    - Agent behaves unexpectedly
    - Failures are hard to reproduce
    - Need root cause analysis fast
    
    ✅ **Agent Reliability Improvement**
    - Track down flaky behavior
    - Understand tool failure patterns
    - Optimize memory retrieval
    
    ✅ **Compliance &amp; Auditability**
    - Explain agent decisions to stakeholders
    - Regulatory requirements for AI systems
    - Decision audit trails
    
    ✅ **Agent Development &amp; Testing**
    - Validate agent behavior in staging
    - Compare decision quality across versions
    - Catch issues before production
    
    **Not Ideal For:**
    ❌ Simple LLM wrappers (non-agentic)
    ❌ Cost-only tracking (use Helicone instead)
    ❌ Prompt engineering for single calls (use LangSmith)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can WhyOps help with agent hallucinations?" icon="brain">
    **Yes, by revealing the cognitive context**
    
    **How Hallucinations Happen:**
    1. Relevant information exists in vector DB
    2. Retrieval fails to surface it (threshold too high, poor query rewriting)
    3. LLM generates answer without context
    4. Result: Hallucination
    
    **How WhyOps Helps:**
    
    ```json
    {
      "step": 2,
      "event": "memory_retrieval",
      "query": "company refund policy",
      "candidates_found": 15,
      "similarity_scores": [0.76, 0.74, 0.72, ...],
      "threshold": 0.80,  ← Too high!
      "candidates_used": 0,  ← Nothing passed threshold
      "result": "No relevant documents found"
    }
    ```
    
    **Root Cause Identified:**
    - Threshold of 0.80 filtered out all 15 relevant documents
    - Best match was 0.76 (very close!)
    - LLM had to answer without context
    
    **Fix:** Lower threshold to 0.70 → retrieval works → hallucination eliminated
    
    See [RAG Mechanics Use Case](/use-cases/rag-mechanics) for more.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does WhyOps help with tool retry issues?" icon="rotate">
    **Exposes Hidden Retry Logic**
    
    **Common Scenario:**
    - Tool call takes 15 seconds
    - User sees "success"
    - No indication of problems
    - Production has random slowdowns
    
    **WhyOps Reveals:**
    ```json
    {
      "event": "tool_execution",
      "tool": "search_api",
      "total_duration_ms": 15000,
      "attempts": [
        {"attempt": 1, "error": "timeout", "duration_ms": 5000},
        {"attempt": 2, "error": "timeout", "duration_ms": 5000},
        {"attempt": 3, "success": true, "duration_ms": 5000}
      ],
      "llm_received": "Success"  ← LLM never saw failures
    }
    ```
    
    **Actionable Insights:**
    - 2 hidden timeouts causing latency
    - Success rate is actually 33%, not 100%
    - Need to investigate API performance
    - Consider reducing retry count or timeout threshold
    
    See [Silent Retries Use Case](/use-cases/silent-retries) for detailed example.
