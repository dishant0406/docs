# WhyOps

WhyOps is the Agent Runtime Observability platform. It does not just show what happened in an agent system. It reconstructs why the system made a decision by capturing the decision environment itself.

<Callout type="info">
WhyOps is currently a concept and architecture. There is no SDK or proxy available yet. This documentation captures the design and strategy.
</Callout>

## The gap in today’s stack

Traditional observability works for deterministic software. Agents are not deterministic. They iterate, use tools, mutate memory, and are guided by planners. Existing tools show LLM calls, not agent cognition.

## The promise

- **Observability shows what happened. WhyOps shows why.**
- Captures the difference between **LLM cognition** and **runtime cognition**.
- Builds a **decision graph** and a **replayable state**.

## How to read these docs

- Start with **Problem Space** and **Core System Model**.
- Follow with **Architecture** and **Event Schema**.
- Use **Implementation Plan** and **Strategy** to guide execution.
