# Welcome to WhyOps

WhyOps is the **Agent Runtime Observability** platform that bridges the gap between what your AI agents do and why they do it.

## The Core Problem

When AI agents behave unexpectedly in production, developers face a fundamental challenge: **agents are un-debuggable because decision state is invisible**.

Traditional observability tools show you:
- API calls made
- Responses received
- Execution traces

But they don't show you:
- Why a specific tool was chosen
- Why the agent retried 4 times
- Why it ignored relevant context
- Why it stopped execution early
- Why it hallucinated despite having correct data

## What WhyOps Does Differently

<Note>
**Observability shows what happened. WhyOps shows why.**
</Note>

WhyOps captures and reconstructs the **cognitive state** of your agents, enabling you to:

1. **See decision reasoning** - Understand which context influenced which decisions
2. **Replay production failures** - Recreate exact agent state for debugging
3. **Track hidden execution** - Surface silent retries, sanitized errors, and runtime decisions
4. **Visualize agent flow** - See your agent's decision graph, not just API logs

## A New Infrastructure Layer

WhyOps represents a **missing layer** in the AI stack:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Model Layer (OpenAI, Anthropic)     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Framework Layer (LangChain, CrewAI) │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Observability (LangSmith, LangFuse) │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ✨ WhyOps - Interpretability Layer  │ ← You are here
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Quick Example

Without WhyOps:
```
❌ Agent failed
❌ Last LLM call looked normal
❌ Spent 4 hours debugging
```

With WhyOps:
```
✅ Agent terminated: max_iterations (5/5 steps used)
✅ Tool 'search_web' failed silently on retry 2
✅ Memory retrieval returned 0 results (threshold too high)
✅ Fixed in 10 minutes
```
