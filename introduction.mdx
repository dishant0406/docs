title: WhyOps Overview
description: Decision infrastructure for agent systems. Understand not just what happened, but why.
---

WhyOps is an Agent Runtime Observability platform. It is a new infrastructure layer that sits between traditional observability and agent execution to make autonomous systems debuggable.

Core idea:
- Observability shows what happened. WhyOps shows why.
- The missing layer is not more logs. It is structured decision context and reproducible state.

Why this exists:
- Agents are non-deterministic, tool-using, memory-influenced, and planner-driven.
- Traditional observability was designed for deterministic software.
- Current LLM tracing tools show API calls, not agent cognition.

What WhyOps captures:
- Decision context at each step (memory retrievals, planner state, tool reality).
- The difference between what actually happened and what the LLM saw.
- The chain of causes that led to a decision.

If you want to build reliable, production-grade agents, you need to see the decision environment, not just the final response.
